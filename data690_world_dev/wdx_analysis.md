### Does a country’s Economic growth reduce the country’s poverty?
Here I want to check wether the econominc growth of a country reduce the poverty in the country. I've choosen this beacuse now a days there is lot of increase in the economic growth in some countries through the world. But while observing the growth of the country, in some courtries there is no reduction in the poverty as it remains same. I've choosen two indicators to compare economy growth among few countries. This is very important to know this because it shows the difference among the people in the countries and the one more important thing is that this poverty creates bias among the people. And by using these indicators we got to know the loop holes and percentage of the people remaining same even after there is alot of change in economic growth from country to country.

13. United States
14. South Africa
### Time Span
- 2010 to 2020
### Comparison in between countries in the year 2010 using visualisation.
- Bar Plot: Here it shows the comparison in between the countries in the year 2010.

- Pie Plot: Here the pie plot shows the values and percentages of the countries with respect to the GDP Per Capita among the proportion of the people below 50% of median income.

- Scatter Plot: Here it shows the comparison between 14 countries. Where it shows the GDP per capita with respect to the year 2010. It also shows the comparison of both indicators in different countries in different percentages and values.

### Conclusion:
From this project we will get to know the percentage of the people who remains in the same position even after the increase in the economic growth in various countries from year to year. Especially it show the data of the indicator we have selected for this project shows the the proportion of the people percentage of 50 with median income compared to GDP Per capita. In this we also get to know the economic growth and poverty of different countries in different regions.The above graphs shows the analysis that I've done till now based on the data. I can study and do furthermore explorations on the data and can do more visualisations.
